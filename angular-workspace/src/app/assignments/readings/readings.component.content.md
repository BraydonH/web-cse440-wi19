## Overview

Assigned readings are worth __5%__ of your overall course grade. 

We expect to assign approximately five readings over the length of the quarter.
Each assigned reading has a corresponding open-ended question that will be submitted and graded.
We have tried to set reading deadlines that give you the flexibility to read before or after the related lectures.
Do whichever is best for your personal learning style.

Responses are expected to be at most several paragraphs.
Their role is to get you engaged with and thinking about the material.
They will be graded according to whether they provide evidence you understood and considered the material in responding.

We will make additional resources available for students as interested.

## Reading 1: Contextual Inquiry and Design Research

<app-assignment-due-text dueText="{{ page.due_reading_design_research }}"></app-assignment-due-text>

Read:

- [Beyer and Holtzblatt (1997). Contextual Design. Chapter 3.]({{ page.link_reading_design_research_file_contextual_inquiry }})

Optionally, check out these additional design method resources:

- [IDEO (2003). Method Cards.]({{ page.link_reading_design_research_file_ideo_method_cards }})
- [Martin and Hanington (2012). Universal Methods of Design.]({{ page.link_reading_design_research_file_universal_methods }})
  
After reading, consider how you might apply this approach to a project proposed in Assignment 1b.
You may complete this reading in terms of your own project proposal,
or you may complete this reading in terms of a "funded" proposal on which you have bid.

- Briefly, what was the proposal (e.g., two sentences).
- Who and what might you propose to observe in a contextual inquiry (e.g., two sentences).
- What focus might you bring to your observation, and why? (e.g., two or three sentences).
- Identify a pitfall or limitation of contextual inquiry (i.e., as a method) or your experience (i.e., as a new design researcher) that seems likely (e.g., two or three sentences).
- Describe how you might avoid or attempt to correct for this pitfall in your inquiry while still primarily using a contextual inquiry method (e.g., two or three sentences).

Then consider alternative design research methods, such as those in the resources above.
Note that you are still in early-stage research,
so the relevant methods from Universal Methods of Design are likely in Design Phase 1 or Design Phase 2.

- Suggest an alternative method you might propose to also apply to the above proposal (e.g., two sentences).
- Describe what additional benefit or complementary perspective it might provide (e.g., three or four sentences).

This reading thus serves as some practice planning design research before moving on to your primary project.

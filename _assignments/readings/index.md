Optionally, check out these high-production "vision of the future" video prototypes:

  - [Starfire](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/videos/videoprototyping/Vision-Sun-Starfire.mp4)
  - [Knowledge Navigator](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/videos/videoprototyping/Vision-Apple-Knowledge-Navigator.mp4)
  - [A Day Made of Glass](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/videos/videoprototyping/Vision-Corning-A-Day-Made-Of-Glass.mp4)

The Starfire video prototype is notable for including a 'bug',
where the system behaves in a manner counter to the person's wishes,
but consistent with how we might expect such technology to work.
For fun, see if you can spot this 'bug' in the video.

After viewing and considering these examples, think about what approaches were more or less effective.

- In one paragraph, describe a technique you saw in these examples that you found highly effective 
  (i.e., in either storyboarding or video prototyping, in the readings or the videos),
  which you might therefore want to apply in your storyboarding or video prototyping.
  Be specific, such that it is clear you considered the examples.
  Discuss why it was effective.  
- In one paragraph, describe a technique you saw that you found ineffective
  (i.e., in either storyboarding or video prototyping, in the readings or the videos),
  which you might therefore want to be mindful of in your storyboarding or video prototyping.
  Be specific, such that it is clear you considered the examples.
  Discuss why it was ineffective.

These examples thus support your reflection on how to effectively convey a design.
Techniques in these and other examples will also directly apply as you prepare your storyboards and video prototypes.

### Reading 3: Paper Prototyping and Usability Testing

Due: {% if page.due_reading_paper_prototyping != nil %}{{ page.due_reading_paper_prototyping }}{% else %}`Date to be added`{% endif %}.

Optionally, check out these additionally paper prototyping resources:

- [Nielsen Norman Group. Paper Prototyping: A How-To Video.](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/videos/paperprototyping/NielsenNorman.mp4)
- [Snyder (2003). Paper Prototyping.]({{ page.link_reading_paper_prototyping_file_snyder }})

After reading, consider how you might apply these techniques in your paper prototyping and usability testing.

- Describe an specific idea or thought you might be able to apply in your paper prototyping and usability testing.
- Describe why this idea is non-obvious or how it well help ensure good results for your paper prototyping and usability testing.
- Describe what in the readings gave you this idea.

Your thoughts here should be specific. 
You are already required to do a paper prototype with usability testing, so that is obviously too high-level for this reading.
Convey a specific idea that indicates you did the reading and thought about how to apply it in the context of your project.

This reading thus serves to get you thinking about these methods in the context of your project.
What actual techniques your team applies will depend on your larger decisions as a team. 
This reading is not intended to require that your team later apply the ideas you individually develop here.

### Reading 4: Patterns

Due: {% if page.due_reading_patterns != nil %}{{ page.due_reading_patterns }}{% else %}`Date to be added`{% endif %}.

Check out these design patterns:

- [van Duyne, Landay, Hong (2003). The Design of Sites: Patterns for Creating Winning Web Sites.]({{ page.link_reading_patterns_file_design_of_sites }})

Consider how one of these patterns, or a pattern you find elsewhere, may be relevant in your project design.

- Briefly, what pattern did you identify as relevant (e.g., by name and ID from Design of Sites, by URL to another pattern).
- Describe why this pattern is relevant in your design.
- Describe how you might incorporate the pattern in your design or adjust your design process based on perspective surfaced by the pattern.
  (e.g., describes changes with text describing what you might change, or consider providing before / after images).

If you wish, you can do this assignment in __pairs__ from your project team.
If you do, include both names in your document.
Also ensure you both upload that document.

This reading thus uses your project as a context to have you engage with a set of patterns.

### Reading 5: Research Paper

Due: Uploaded the night before section
{% if page.date_reading_research != nil %}{{ page.date_reading_research }}{% else %}`Date to be added`{% endif %}.

Researchers and designers often re-invent, leading to the popular saying that
"A year in the field can save you an hour in the library".
It is valuable to take advantage of what is already known.
To do this, you need to find and understand prior results.

Find and read a research paper related to your project.
The paper does not necessarily have to describe an app or device.
For example, the research paper may describe results of surveys or interviews on how people currently track something related to your project.

We have discussed a number of research papers in this class from leading HCI-related conferences such as:

- [CHI](https://chi2017.acm.org/)
- [CSCW](https://cscw.acm.org/2017/)
- [UIST](https://uist.acm.org/uist2017/)
- [UbiComp](http://ubicomp.org/ubicomp2017/)

You might find a relevant research paper in another related field, such as psychology or medicine. Some conferences at the intersection of technology and health include:

- [AMIA](https://www.amia.org/)
- [PervasiveHealth](http://pervasivehealth.org/)

Many papers are available via the [ACM Digital Library](http://dl.acm.org/) or on author websites.

Unfortunately, search functionality within the ACM Digital Library is generally poor. A better choice is typically [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/).

These resources are easiest to access while on the UW network, but you can also access them off campus using the [UW Libraries proxy](http://www.lib.washington.edu/help/connect.html).

- In one paragraph, summarize the findings of the research paper.
  - What were the main points of this paper?
  - Given the content of the paper, critique those main points. Do you believe them? What are their limitations?
- In one paragraph, describe how the paper might apply to your project.
  - After reading this paper, is there anything you might wish you had done differently?
  - Is there some insight from this paper that you can apply in your design?
  - Do you think you have designed something that improves upon a design this paper discusses?

If you wish, you can do this assignment in __pairs__ from your project team. If you do so, please both submit and include both of your names in the submission.
